# COVID19Simulation

Customizable environment for COVID-19 spread simulation based on the SIR model.

There are some pre-created simulation scenes:
1. CommonRoom - There is a one big common room, where people freely walk around.
2. CommonRoomWIthCommonShop - Same as CommonRoom, but this has added small shop room, that people randomly enter or exit.
3. DistrictsWithShops - Instead of one common space here the world is divided into districts, where each has its own shop. People can't go to other districts or their shops, but disease can be spread from district to district when infected and susceptible people are close to borders of their districts.

It's also very easy to create your own custom simulation scenario.
